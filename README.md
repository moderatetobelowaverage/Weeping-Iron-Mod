# Summary
The Weeping Iron mod is a quilt mod aims to rework the vanilla progression tiers through crafting changes, stat modifications, and a whole new post-nether equipment tier. All packaged in a way that emphasizes minecrafts quasi-lore, and makes each new/reworked tier feel flavorful and full of character. At its core the goal of this mod is to change and slow down vanilla progression, making upgrading past iron and into the mid-late game a more memorable and interesting experience.

## Vanilla Changes
The crafting recipes of both diamond and netherite equipment have been changed to reposition them in progression, as well as their stats to better suit their new placement.

### Diamond Tools
Diamond tools now require a block of diamond, and Sculk vein.

incentivising you to dig deep into the overworld and explore before you can go to the nether, making your iron equipment take up a lot longer time overall in your game.

### Diamond Armor
Diamond Armor is now an endgame recipe, being an upgrade of chainmail armor (obtained in the usual ways) using dragons breath, and a diamond block

The Idea of this was to make diamond armor a far more interesting accomplishment, taking advantage of the (in my opinion interesting) difficulty of finding chainmail armor, and adding dragons breath to make it a reward for "beating" the game. As a part of this change to be endgame, diamond and netherite have had their armor toughness values swapped, making diamond technically "the best" tier of armor (if you have no value for knockback protection).

### Netherite Equipment
Netherite equipment (both tools and armor) is now a direct upgrade of gold equipment.

and as mentioned previous it has also had its armor toughness value swapped with diamond. the goal with this was to make netherites more interesting properties (immunity to being destroyed in fire and knockback resistance) stand out slightly more as *reasons* to use it *instead of* a "more powerful" equipment tier. Hopefully implementing more horizontal progression to the game.

## Additions!

### Raw Weeping Amalgam
Raw Weeping Iron is a material/decorative block made with 4 crying obsidian, a block of raw iron, and 4 of either soul sand or soul soil.

The crafting recipe outputs a block of Raw Weeping Amalgam](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/noz094yT/images/ad09401b12d5ed02e67eb6ae38ec0037b2d8ad28.png)
Raw Weeping Amalgam is the base raw material of all the new equipment in this mod.

### Block of Weeping Iron
A block of Weeping Iron is made by smelting Raw Weeping Amalgam in a blast furnace.

the Block of Weeping Iron is used to craft Weeping Iron Equipment, and can be unpacked into/repacked from 9 Weeping Iron Ingots.

### Weeping Iron Equipment
Weeping Iron Equipment is a new equipment tier. In most cases it has stats between that of vanilla iron and diamond, but it has a higher durability and knockback resistance than Netherite, and is repaired using Weeping Iron Ingots. Weeping Iron equipment is crafted by upgrading Iron equipment with a block of Weeping Iron in the smithing table

# About this project
This is my first published mod, I am absolutely a newbie developer, If you encounter any bugs please submit them here and I will try to fix them. This mod was made for my modpack (yet to be named or published), I do this primarily for my own enjoyment and that of the friends I play modded minecraft with. I do not know if (but doubt) this mod will be updated past 1.20.1. I may add new features (I do really dislike single purpose materials) but I also might not.

# Why quilt? not fabric
The modpack I developed this for is on quilt, as a new dev I am more or less modloader agnostic (equally clueless coding for all of them) so I decided to make this mod on quilt for ease of integration later down the line. If this mod ever gets more than a few downloads and requests about it, I may port it to fabric (but once again, I might not)

# Acknowledgements
This mod *would not* have been possible without the quilt development wiki, and the quilt template mod, nor without the fabric developement wiki.
